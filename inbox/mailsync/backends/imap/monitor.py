        Notes
        -----
        Generic IMAP uses folders (not labels). Inbox canonical and other
        folders are created as Folder objects only accordingly.

        Gmail uses IMAP folders and labels. Inbox canonical folders are
        therefore mapped to both Folder and Label objects, everything else is
        created as a Label only.

        We don't canonicalize folder names to lowercase when saving because
        different backends may be case-sensitive or otherwise - code that
        references saved folder names should canonicalize if needed when doing
        comparisons.
